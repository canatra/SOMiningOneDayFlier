# SOMiningOneDayFlier
### Authors: Joy Bushnell, Haifa Aldossari, Samiha Shimmi
## Files included in this repository:
#### OneDayFliesQuery.docx contains the SQL statements used to create our onedayflies table
#### RQ1.docx includes all of the queries for research question 1
#### For RQ 2 tagfreq.py calculates the tag frequency for RQ 2 to run python tagfreq.py
#### For RQ 3 deletedPosts.py counts the number of deleted posts that are in one day flies and not one day flies, combined.csv is the file that we imported from the stackexchange table postswithdeleted.
#### For RQ 4 there are two files RQ4 Methodology.docx and RQ4.docx. The first file includes the methodology and the second file includes the sql queries used for research question 4.
####  For RQ 5 we use RQ5.R after downloading the onedayflies answer count and the not onedayflies answer count.
#### For RQ 6 we used two parts
##### Part 1: RQ6 part1.R Matches the onedayflies in our set to current posts after July 31, 2012. This will tell us if the users have posted again, i.e. thes users that are no longer onedayflies.
##### Part 2: We used two files RQ6 part2.R and RQ6 part3.R. The first file is preprocessing the data, we start by getting the columns that we need to find the average date. In the second file we match onedayflies to current posts and write data into a csv file. In Excel we calculate the average number of days before the user posts again.
#### detailed report.pdf contains the detailed report for our data mining class
